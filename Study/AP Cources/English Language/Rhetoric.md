### The three artistic proofs, Ethos, Pathos, and Logos, are modes of persuasion used to convince audiences.

1. Ethos:
    - Ethos appeals to the credibility, trustworthiness, and expertise of the speaker or writer.
    - It aims to establish the speaker's authority and convince the audience that they are knowledgeable and reliable.
    - Ethos can be established through the speaker's credentials, reputation, or expertise in the subject matter.
    - It is important in building trust and credibility with the audience.
2. Pathos:
    - Pathos appeals to the emotions and feelings of the audience.
    - It aims to evoke an emotional response and create a connection with the audience.
    - Pathos can be achieved through storytelling, vivid descriptions, and language that evokes strong emotions.
    - It is effective in engaging the audience and influencing their attitudes and beliefs.
3. Logos:
    - Logos appeals to logic, reason, and evidence.
    - It aims to persuade the audience through logical arguments, facts, and evidence.
    - Logos relies on clear and coherent reasoning, the use of statistics, examples, and expert opinions.
    - It is effective in presenting a rational and logical case to support the speaker's or writer's arguments.

These three artistic proofs work together to create persuasive and compelling communication that appeals to both the rational and emotional aspects of the audience.

# Popular rhetorical devices

- Strategy
- Style
- Organization
- Analysis of reading

# Functions for Rhetoric

1. To persuade
2. To inform
3. To entertain
4. To express

# Rhetorical Devices in AP Lang:

## Alliteration(头韵)

- Function:
    1. Musical effect
    2. Easy to read and recite
    3. Create beauty

## Allusion(用典)

- Function: 用一个简短的东西让人知道这是什么

## Allegory(寓言)

- Function: To tell a story to teach an idea and a principle or explain an idea or a principle.

## Analogy(类比)

- Function: 用一个简单的东西类比一个难的东西
- The most useful form of the analogy is one in which a simple argument is substituted for a more complex argument to help your readers understand the underlying premise.
- Analogies clarify and expand ideas in much the same way that pop-up greeting cards heighten the impact of the message.

## Simile (like/as/so) (明喻)

*A simile is a device in which the writer compares two things already somewhat related.*

- Function: 可以比较两个名词，或者一个名词和一个短语，或者两个短语
- You can tell your reader a great deal by pointing out that something is not like, or is unlike, something else. You can also use a negative simile to connect two things that are not actually not like. (反喻)
- **182882**
- *12828*

## Metaphor(隐喻)

> E.g.,
> 
> - A is B.
> - A, ___.

***Comparison:** The metaphor is a close relative of the simile - so close that it is sometimes difficult to tell them apart. While a simile compares something by pointing out how they are alike, a metaphor speaks of one thing as though it actually were another.*

| analogy | 用来描述一个事物的特征，让读者更有画面 | 一种理性的、逻辑的、教育的情感，用来说明两个事物之间的相似性和差异 | 用来解释一个复杂或抽象的概念，让读者更容易理解 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| metaphor | 一种直接的比喻，用来把一个事物说成另一个事物 | 一种创造性的、想象力的、诗意的情感，用来把一个事物说成另一个事物 | 用来增强语言的表现力，让读者更有感觉 |
| simile | 一种间接的比喻，用“像”“如”等词来把两个事物进行比较 | 一种直观的、形象的、比较的情感，用来把两个事物进行比较 | 用来描述一个事物的特征，让读者更有画面 |
1. 隐喻更有文学性，传达更多的情感
2. A writer often uses a metaphor strategically to help you see a deeper truth about something.

## Antecedent(先行词)

*A pronoun refers to a word, phrase, or clause.*

是指在文学作品中，多个句子或段落以相同的词或短语开头，以强调某个主题或情感。例如，“我有一个梦想，那就是……”就是马丁·路德·金在他的著名演讲中使用的顺接的例子。顺接可以表达说话者或作者的热情，增强语言的气势和韵律。

## Apostrophe(呼语)

*A figure of speech that directly addresses an absent or imaginary person or a personified, such as liberty or love. It is an address to someone or something that cannot be answered.*

- Apostrophe involves changing the direction of the narrative to address a person or object.

是指在演说、抒情文章中或诗歌中突然用第二人称对不在场的人或对拟人的事物发出呼语，例如 "O Death, where is thy sting?"

1. The apostrophe is a forceful, emotional device.
2. 不在正式写作中使用。增强情感上的呼吁。

## Hyperbole(夸张)

*注意不一定大数字就是夸张，可能是陈诉*

In our daily conversation, we use hyperbole to create an amusing effect or to emphasize our meaning. However, in literature, it has very serious implications.

1. Make points stronger.
2. Ironic.
3. Demonstrating the difference.

## Understatement(轻描淡写)

3. Add ironic effects.
4. Humorous effect.

## Imagery(形象化描写)

*use sensory details and figurative language to reply to objects, actions, ideas, etc. → appeals to physical senses*

- create visual representation in our mind. (visualize)

</aside>

## Invective(脏话)

*emotionally violent, verbal denunciation or attack using strong & abusive language*

## Innuendo(含沙射影)

*a mild form of irony, hinting in a rather roundabout way at something disparaging or complimentary to the person or subject mentioned*

Literature abounds with Innuendo - especially romantic poetry, novels, and dramas.

> Example:
> 
> 
> I stopped at page 412, with 407 pages to go. (The Atlantic, August,1981)
> 
> There is too much to read
> 
> The weatherman said it would be warm. He must take his readings in a bathroom. (David Parks: G.l. Diary)

## Sarcasm(尖酸刻薄)

*involve bitter, caustic language*

- a form of verbal irony that mocks, ridicules, or expresses contempt. Like you are saying the opposite of what you mean (verbal irony) and doing it in a particularly hostile tone.

> Example:
> 
> 1. Ugliness can be fixed, stupidity is forever.
> 2. I’m not insulting you. I’m just describing you.
> 3. I’d agree with you, but then we’d both be wrong.
> 
> Quote:
> 
> 1. “I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.” —Fred Allen
> 2. “History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely once they have exhausted all other alternatives.” —Abba Eban
> 3. “Have no fear of perfection — you’ll never reach it.” — Salvador Dali
- It may use irony as a device, but not all ironic statements are sarcasm.

## Euphemism

- *substitution of mild or vague or roundabout expression for harsh or direct one; expression thus substituted.*
- *substitution of an agreeable or inoffensive expression for one that may offend or suggest something unpleasant.*

> Example:

> To pass away, to depart, to go to sleep, to go to heaven
> 2. old age, senility
> past one’s prime, second childhood
> 3. old people
> senior citizen

> Gen’s, the John, washroom, head (Navy)
> 2. Women's lavatory
> Ladies, the powder room
> 
> **C. Poverty and unemployment, etc.**
> 
> 1. Dismiss, sack
> lay off, ease out
> 2. Penniless
> out of pocket, in reduced circumstances
> 3. In debt
> in difficulties, in embarrassing obligation to
> 4. The poor
> the have-nots (haves), the underprivileged
> 
> **D. Political and military activities**
> 
> 1. Lies
> economical with the truth
> 2. Admit defeat

## Paradox(悖论)/Oxymoron(矛盾修辞法)

*a figure of speech wherein the author groups apparently contradictory terms to suggest a paradox.*

> Example:
> 
> - bitter-sweet memories
> - proud humility
> - a miserable, Merry Christmas
> - orderly chaos
> - same difference
> - controlled chaos
> - “True Lies”
> - friendly fight
> - false truth
> - organized mess

***Oxymoron*** can help us to appreciate more fully the implied complexity of descriptions and feelings.

> Example:
> 
> - sweet sorrow

***Paradox*** is a figure of speech consisting of a statement or proposition that, on the face of it, seems self-contradictory, absurd, or contrary to established fact or practice but which, on further thinking and study, may prove to be true, well-founded, and even to contain a succinct point.

- The use of Oxymoron:
    - express a sense of irony
        - enhance drama
        - be an excellent tool for creating humor for a reader
    - enhance drama in writing
    - create humor
1. Engage reader to discover and underline logic → allows the reader to understand the concept in a different and irrational way
2. Create verbal or situational irony

> - n + n
> 
> 
> love-hate relationship
> 
> a fire-water state
> 
>  - v + adv.
> 
> die merrily
> 
> shine darkly

    … *numerous, but they act as an organizing force to:*
    
    1. attract the reader’s attention;
    2. add emphasis and organization;
    3. simply provide a musical rhythm.
- Parallelism is useful for keep long lists understandable or for making long parenthetical comments less cumbersome.

    ### Chiasmus
    
    *a special form of Parallelism that flip the original form around*
    
    > e.g.
    > 
    > 
    > Parallelism: “He smiled happily and laughed joyfully.”
    > 
    > Chiasmus: “He smiled happily and joyfully laughed.”
    > 
    - … is stylistically more ornate than standard parallelism and can lend some extra impact to your statement.
    - If your spot it, then it usually means that the writer thinks the statement is worthy of closer attention.
    - Sentences that include a chiasmus might be used
    - to give emphasis to an idea or to make a statement more memorable.

### Confounding Variable

*A hidden premise is a part of the argument’s logical structure, even though it’s unstated.*

## Antithesis(反对论点)

*… is a literary device that refers to the juxtaposition of two opposing elements through the parallel grammatical structure.* 

- It uses a contrast in language to bring a contrast in ideas.
- It organizes ideas in a way that is both evocative and powerful.
- It can be built by contrasting any of the different parts of a statement.

## Hypophora(设问)

*… is the technique of asking a question and then proceeding to answer it, and it’s one of the most useful strategic devices when writing an essay to inform or persuade.*

- The use of it is …
    - to introduce a paragraph.
    - to anticipate questions or concerns you think your reader might raise, and help strenthen your case.

## Rhetorical Question

*is something of a cousin to hypophora*

- Hypophora offers the writer an opportunity to tell readers something they don’t know, and this one gives the writer the opportunity to highlight something that readers do know.
- The answer is as apparent to your readers as it is to you.

## Procatalepsis(预先驳斥)

*… can ask any sort of question; the procatalepsis deals specifically with objections, and it usually does so without even asking the question.* 

- It lets the writer further his or her argument and satisfy readers at the same time by directly address the objections.
- It can be used in following ways:
    - Determine what the most likely, common, or troubling objections to your arguments are, then offer strong answers to those objections.
    - You may come up with your own argument, specifically to bolster your central point. By coming up with potential problems for which you already have a clear answer, you make it appear that the point you are trying to define has been well through-out and can withstand critisim.

## Distinctio(定义)

*is a rhetorical form in which the writer elaborates on the definition of a word, to make sure there is no misunderstanding*

- It allows you to tell your reader exactly what you mean.
- It is usually used with a linking phrase. And it may be used by putting a definition in parenthesis immediately after the term you have written.

## Enumeratio(列举)

- It refers to the act of supplying a list of details about something.
- It may also be effectively combined with hypophora as an introduction.
- By spending sufficient time outlining its details, you send a clear message to the reader about the importance of your main idea.

## Mood

*As a literary device, mood refers to the emotional response that the writer wishes to evoke in the reader through a story.*

Create a memorable and meaningful story with which the creader can connect.

- Emotional response that the writer wishes to evoke in the reader thorough a story.
    - Joyful
    - Pensive
    - Cheerful
    - Nervous
    - Resentful
    - Uneasy
    - Peaceful
    - Angry
    - Hopeless
    - Melancholy
    - Hopeful
    - Stressed
    - Panicked

## Tone

*describes the author’s attitude towards his material, the audience, or both.*

- The tone is easier to determine in spoken language.
- Tone decides how the readers read a literary piece, and how they should fell while they are reading it.
- The tone made the mood.

## Symbol/Symbolism(象征)

*The symbol is something that stands for or suggests something else; it represents something beyond the literal meaning.*

- Usually symbol is something concrete that represents something abstract.
- It can be used to give authors’ work more meaning and to make the story be about more than the event it describes.

*Symbolism means an artistic and poetic expression or style using figurative images and indirect ideas to express abstract concepts. The specific meaning may vary in different circumstances.*

- It gives a writer the freedom to add double levels of meaning to his work.

## Asyndeton/Polysyndeton/Parataxis

*These are two forms that add stylistic force to your writing by handling conjunctions in nonstandard ways.* 

- The former one leaves out conjunction in a list or between clauses, while another puts conjunction between every item.
- Asyndeton can be used for these reasons:
    - It gives a feeling of fast movement to the writing, rather than a list that drags out.
    - Define the second item as the clarification of the first item.
- Poly is the stylistic opposite of asyndeton
    - Polysyndeton 是重复使用平等连词的修辞手法，不用逗号或其他标点符号，使句子更加冗长、缓慢、累赘
    - Polysyndeton 可以减慢句子的速度和力度，表达一种沉重或兴奋的情绪
- Parataxis involves listing a series of clauses with no conjunctions. And it must relate to clauses.
    - It also implies a sense of immediacy.
    - It is also used to set a scene.

## Synecdoche/Metonymy

*The former one is the use of a part of something to represent the whole, while the other allows you to refer to something closely related to the actual thing.*

- Synecdoche uses a part of something to represent the whole.
- Metonymy allows you to refer to something closely related to the actual object and use that transfer to the object itself.
    - Allow you to surprise and delight your readers and invite them to consider a familiar idea from a new angle.

## Personification

*Give human attributes to something non-human. It might be an animal, an inanimate object, or an abstract concept.*

## Sentenia

*It’s simply a fancy item for a quotation, maxim, or wise saying. And it’s the rhetorical device mostly commonly used to illustrate and sum up a point.*

## Exemplum

*Provide reader with an example*

## Antagonists/Protagonist

*正角/反角*
