Here is the writing prompt:

> Read the following excerpt from The Decline of Radicalism (1969) by Daniel J. Boorstin and consider the implications of the distinction Boorstin makes between dissent and disagreement. Then, using appropriate evidence, write a carefully reasoned essay in which you defend, challenge, or qualify Boorstin's distinction.
> Dissent is the great problem of America today. It overshadows all others. It is a symptom, an expression, a consequence, and a cause of all others.
I say dissent and not disagreement. And it is the distinction between dissent and disagreement which I really want to make. Disagreement produces debate but dissent produces dissension. Dissent (which comes from the Latin, dis and sentire) means originally to feel apart from others.
> People who disagree have an argument, but people who dissent have a quarrel. People may disagree and both may count themselves in the majority. But a person who dissents is by definition in a minority. A liberal society thrives on disagreement but is killed by dissension. Disagreement is the lifeblood of democracy, dissension is its cancer.

### Thesis Statement:
- Daniel J. Boorstin, in "The Decline of Radicalism," asserts a significant distinction between dissent and disagreement, where disagreement is a healthy democratic process, but dissent can be detrimental to societal harmony. This essay will examine the nuances of Boorstin's argument, weighing its validity and implications in contemporary society.

### Topic Sentence:

- Firstly, disagreement is an essential and constructive part of democracy, fostering diverse viewpoints and robust debates, as highlighted by Boorstin.

- Secondly, dissent, as opposed to disagreement, often leads to social division and conflict, reflecting Boorstin's perspective that it acts more as a disruptive force than a constructive one.

- Finally, while Boorstin's distinction between dissent and disagreement is insightful, it is important to consider instances where dissent might be necessary and beneficial for societal progress, challenging the binary view presented by Boorstin.
